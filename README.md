# Labyrinth Pathfinder

This is an obligatory assignment I did for IN1010 at UiO.
The program finds all possible exits out of any labyrinth written
in the format of the .in files in this repository. The project involved
creating a custom sorted linked list implementation, creating a simple GUI,
using multithreading to increase the speed at which exits are found
and lots of object oriented programming.
Sadly this was made using the built in JavaFX library in Java 8
which was taken out in later versions so you need to use Java 8 to
run this. To run the program simply compile all .java files and run 
```
$ java Oblig7
```
and choose the .in file you want.
